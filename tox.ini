# Building docs has a direct dependency on Sphinx. Additionally, to ensure import-time logic in
# girder executes correctly, funcsigs and six should be installed and not be mocked during
# documentation import / building. Finally, documentation dependencies are listed in a separate file
# to allow readthedocs.org to read and install them.

# limitations of Tox (not being able to use a different install_command for deps installation and
# package installation) and the desire to install cleanly via pip (instead of directly with
# setuptools), skip_install and an explicit "pip install" run command seems to be the best
# configuration possible.
